The story should be developmentally appropriate for young children and should include:

A relatable main character (human or animal) who is feeling very anxious or scared.

A simple plot that shows the character recognizing, expressing, and working through their anxiety in a safe, comforting way.

Positive coping strategies suitable for a young child, such as deep breathing, talking to a trusted adult, using imagination, or focusing on calming thoughts.

A reassuring and hopeful ending, showing that the character feels better and knows it’s okay to have big feelings.

Use warm, encouraging language, age-appropriate vocabulary, and a tone that is both soothing and empowering.

Do not include direct clinical explanations or diagnostic terms—this should feel like a bedtime story, not a therapy session.
Write it in US English. Start with the story right away, no introduction. Use simple words and short sentences.""",

Supportive coping strategies appropriate for young children, such as talking about feelings, being comforted by a loved one, doing something kind or creative, or spending time with someone who cares.

Age-appropriate coping strategies for managing anger, such as taking deep breaths, using words to talk about feelings, taking a break, squeezing a pillow, or asking for help.

A warm, reassuring ending where the character feels calmer, understands their emotions better, and knows it’s okay to feel mad sometimes—and that they can choose what to do with those feelings.
