He lived in the sky above Whispering Woods.\n\nTonight, Barnaby felt a little curious. He drifted gently down, down, down towards the woods. The trees looked like tall, green giants, all hushed and still. A soft breeze whispered secrets through their leaves. *Shhh… shhh…* it went.\n\nBarnaby floated past a cozy little burrow. He peeked inside. A sleepy bunny, Cottontail, was curled up in a nest of soft moss. Cottontail yawned a big, pink yawn. \"Oh, hello, Barnaby,\" Cottontail mumbled. \"It's getting sleepy time.\"\n\nBarnaby felt a little sad. He wanted to do something kind. \"Would you like a little sparkle, Cottontail?\" he asked softly.\n\nCottontail blinked his sleepy eyes. \"A sparkle?\"\n\nBarnaby gently puffed out a tiny bit of shimmering light. It danced around Cottontail, like a friendly firefly. The light was a soft, gentle gold. Cottontail smiled a tiny bunny smile. \"That's lovely, Barnaby. Thank you.\"\n\nBarnaby felt warm inside. It felt good to make Cottontail happy. He floated a little further into the woods. He saw a tiny, twinkling star fallen to the forest floor. It wasn't shining very brightly.\n\n\"Oh dear,\" Barnaby whispered. He gently nudged the star with his fluffy edge. He puffed out a little bit of his cloud-softness around it. The star began to glow, a soft, gentle blue. It twinkled brighter and brighter.\n\n\"Thank you, Barnaby,\" the star whispered. \"You helped me find my sparkle again.\"\n\nBarnaby smiled. He felt happy and peaceful. He drifted back up, up, up towards the night sky. The stars were like tiny diamonds scattered on a velvet cloth. The moon shone a gentle, silver light.\n\nHe floated back to his spot amongst the other clouds. They were all soft and quiet, like fluffy sheep. The breeze whispered a lullaby. *Hush now… hush now…*\n\nBarnaby felt so calm and cozy. He closed his cloud-eyes. The world felt soft and safe. He drifted off to sleep, dreaming of sparkly stars and sleepy bunnies. He knew that tomorrow would be a new day, full of gentle breezes and quiet wonders. And for now, he was perfectly happy, resting in the arms of the night.\n\nSleep tight, little one. The stars are watching over you. Shhh… shhh… drift off to dreamland.\n"
