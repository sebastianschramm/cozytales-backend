He watched it drift higher and higher, until it was just a tiny speck against the big, blue sky. Barnaby’s tummy felt like it had a little knot in it.\n\nHe sat under his favorite oak tree. Usually, he loved playing with his friends, Rosie the rabbit and Finley the fox. But today, he didn’t want to play. He just wanted to feel…better.\n\nMama Bear came and sat beside him. She didn’t say anything at first. She just put her arm around Barnaby. He leaned into her, and she gave him a gentle squeeze.\n\n“Oh, Mama,” Barnaby whispered. “My balloon is gone. And I feel sad.”\n\nMama Bear nodded. “It’s okay to feel sad when something you love is lost, Barnaby. It’s a big feeling.”\n\nBarnaby sniffled. “I miss it. I miss watching it float.”\n\n“I know you do,” Mama Bear said softly. “It’s alright to miss things. Sometimes, things disappear, even when we wish they wouldn’t.”\n\nBarnaby looked at his paws. He felt a little bit like his balloon – floating away and lost.\n\nMama Bear pulled out her knitting. “Sometimes, when we feel sad, it helps to do something kind. Would you like to help me make a little scarf for Rosie? She’s been feeling a bit under the weather.”\n\nBarnaby thought about Rosie. He loved Rosie. He nodded. He carefully helped Mama Bear choose soft, green yarn. He didn’t talk much, but he focused on making the stitches. It felt good to do something for someone else.\n\nAs they knitted, Mama Bear told Barnaby stories about all the wonderful things they could do together – baking berry pies, reading stories by the fire, and going for walks in the meadow.\n\nBarnaby started to feel a little bit lighter. The knot in his tummy wasn’t quite so tight. He realized that even though his balloon was gone, he still had Mama Bear, and he still had Rosie and Finley. He still had so many things to be happy about.\n\nWhen the scarf was finished, it was a beautiful, soft green. Barnaby carefully wrapped it and imagined Rosie’s happy face when she received it.\n\n“Thank you, Mama,” Barnaby said. “I feel a little bit better.”\n\nMama Bear smiled. “You are a very kind bear, Barnaby. And it’s okay to feel sad sometimes. It doesn’t mean you’re not strong. It just means you have a big heart.”\n\nBarnaby hugged Mama Bear tight. He knew the sadness might come back again, but he also knew he wasn’t alone. He had Mama Bear, and he had his friends. And even though his blue balloon was gone, the world was still full of beautiful things to see and do. He even thought maybe, just maybe, he’d ask Finley to help him build a new, even better, kite.\n\n\n\n"
